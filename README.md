        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring data analyst currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Analytics at Northeastern University with a stellar GPA of 3.95. My academic journey is underpinned by a strong foundation in computer science from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University in India, where I graduated with a CGPA of 9.5. My skill set spans a wide array of technical competencies, including data analysis, predictive analytics, machine learning, and a robust proficiency in tools like SQL, Python, R, and Tableau.

My professional experience includes impactful internships where I have automated data processes, enhanced data-driven decision-making, and developed predictive models that significantly improve strategic outcomes. Notably, I have transformed examination processes at Edofox and supported major clients like Swiggy and Ease My Trip at Yoshops with dynamic pricing strategies. My academic projects further demonstrate my capability to handle complex datasets and develop insights that drive business strategy and operational efficiency.

I am passionate about using data to tell compelling stories and drive business intelligence. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to apply my skills in data science to solve real-world problems, aiming to blend analytical rigor with strategic thinking.</p>
